# Footway/Sidewalk Filtering Implementation

## Problem Solved

The genetic algorithm was generating routes that repeatedly used both roads and their adjacent sidewalks/footways, creating redundant back-and-forth patterns on the same street. This happened because OpenStreetMap represents roads and sidewalks as separate parallel paths.

## Solution Overview

Implemented intelligent footway filtering that removes `highway=footway` segments from the route planning graph by default, preventing the GA from creating redundant parallel path routes.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Route Optimizer Service (`route_services/route_optimizer.py`)

**New Parameter:**
- Added `exclude_footways: bool = True` parameter to `optimize_route()` method

**New Methods:**
- `_filter_graph_for_routing()`: Creates filtered copy of graph excluding footway edges
- Updated all filtering methods to accept optional graph parameter

**Key Features:**
- Creates filtered graph copy (preserves original)
- Removes edges with `highway=footway` 
- Removes isolated nodes after edge removal
- Reports filtering statistics: "Footway filtering: removed X/Y footway edges, Z isolated nodes"

### 2. CLI Interface (`cli_route_planner.py`)

**New Command Line Option:**
```bash
--include-footways    Include footway/sidewalk segments (default is to exclude them)
```

**Interactive Mode:**
- Added prompt: "Include footways/sidewalks? (can cause redundant back-and-forth routes) (y/n) [n]:"
- Default is 'n' (exclude footways)

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Default behavior (excludes footways)
python cli_route_planner.py --start-node 1529188403 --distance 5.0 --algorithm genetic

# Include footways if desired
python cli_route_planner.py --start-node 1529188403 --distance 5.0 --algorithm genetic --include-footways
```

### 3. Streamlit Web App (`running_route_app.py`)

**New UI Control:**
- Checkbox: "Exclude footways/sidewalks" (checked by default)
- Help text: "Prevents redundant back-and-forth routes on parallel sidewalks and roads. Recommended for most users."

**Integration:**
- Passes `exclude_footways` parameter to route optimization
- User can toggle on/off as needed

## Technical Implementation

### Graph Filtering Process

1. **Copy Creation**: Creates copy of original graph to preserve connectivity
2. **Edge Removal**: Identifies and removes all edges where `highway=footway`
3. **Node Cleanup**: Removes nodes that become isolated after edge removal
4. **Statistics**: Reports filtering impact to user

### Algorithm Integration

Both TSP and Genetic Algorithm optimizers:
- Accept filtered graph for optimization
- Use filtered graph for all distance calculations and pathfinding
- Maintain full functionality with reduced search space

### Backwards Compatibility

- **Default behavior**: Footways excluded (solves the redundancy problem)
- **Explicit inclusion**: Users can include footways if desired via CLI flag or web checkbox
- **No breaking changes**: All existing code continues to work

## Impact Analysis

### Benefits

1. **Eliminates Redundancy**: Prevents back-and-forth routes on parallel roads/sidewalks
2. **Cleaner Routes**: More logical, single-path routes along streets
3. **Better Performance**: Smaller graph size improves optimization speed
4. **User Control**: Can be disabled if footway access specifically needed

### OSM Data Context

From analysis of Christiansburg, VA network:
- **35% footways**: 1,236 of 3,528 total segments
- **Parallel paths**: Many footways run parallel to residential/primary roads
- **Filtering impact**: Significant reduction in redundant routing options

### When to Include Footways

Users might want to include footways when:
- Planning routes in pedestrian-only areas
- Seeking very specific path variations
- Analyzing complete network connectivity
- Creating routes for accessibility analysis

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Automatic filtering statistics reporting
- Validation that filtered graphs maintain connectivity
- Preservation of original graph for other uses
- Integration testing with both TSP and GA algorithms

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully addresses the redundant path issue while maintaining user control and system flexibility. The default exclude-footways behavior provides cleaner, more practical running routes while the option to include them preserves full functionality when needed.

**Default recommendation: Keep footways excluded for most running route use cases.**
