# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **refactored Python geospatial analysis project** focused on running route optimization using OpenStreetMap data and elevation information. The project uses a **shared services architecture** to eliminate code duplication between CLI and web applications, providing optimized running routes for Christiansburg, Virginia.

**Key Architecture Changes:**
- âœ… **Refactored to shared services**: Zero code duplication between applications
- ðŸš§ **Genetic Algorithm Implementation**: New GA-based route optimization approach alongside existing TSP solvers
- ðŸŽ¯ **Enhanced Elevation Optimization**: Segment-based encoding for superior elevation gain routes
- ðŸ“Š **Development Visualizations**: OpenStreetMap-based route visualization during GA development

## Environment Setup

This project uses Python 3.12.3 with a virtual environment located in `venv/`. To activate the environment and run the code:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python route.py
```

## Key Dependencies

The project relies on several geospatial and data visualization libraries (available in `venv/`):
- `osmnx` - OpenStreetMap network analysis
- `networkx` (3.4.2) - Graph analysis and manipulation
- `numpy` (2.2.1) - Numerical computations
- `matplotlib` - Plotting and visualization  
- `streamlit` - Web application framework
- `folium` - Interactive maps
- `plotly` - Interactive visualizations
- `pandas` - Data manipulation

## Code Architecture

**Refactored Shared Services Architecture:**

### Shared Route Services (`route_services/`)
- **NetworkManager** - Graph loading, caching, node operations
- **RouteOptimizer** - Multi-algorithm optimization (TSP + Genetic Algorithm)
  - TSP solvers with automatic fast/standard fallback
  - **NEW**: Genetic Algorithm with segment-based encoding
  - Automatic algorithm selection based on objective
- **RouteAnalyzer** - Route analysis, statistics, turn-by-turn directions
- **ElevationProfiler** - Elevation profile generation and analysis
- **RouteFormatter** - Platform-agnostic output formatting
- **GAVisualizer** - ðŸš§ **IN DEVELOPMENT**: GA development visualizations

### Applications (Using Shared Services)
- **CLI Route Planner** (`cli_route_planner.py`) - Command-line interface
- **Streamlit Web App** (`running_route_app.py`) - Interactive web interface

### Core Utilities
- `route.py` - Core geospatial utility functions
- **TSP Solvers:**
  - `tsp_solver_fast.py` - Optimized TSP solver without distance matrix
  - `tsp_solver.py` - Standard TSP solver with distance matrix
- **Genetic Algorithm (ðŸš§ IN DEVELOPMENT):**
  - `genetic_route_optimizer.py` - GA implementation with segment-based encoding
  - `ga_chromosome.py` - Route chromosome and segment representations
  - `ga_operators.py` - Crossover, mutation, and selection operators
  - `ga_visualizer.py` - Development visualization tools
- `graph_cache.py` - Network caching utilities

### Data Files
- `srtm_38_03.tif` - SRTM elevation data for the region
- `srtm_data/` - Contains additional SRTM data files and documentation
- `cache/` - Contains cached JSON data files (likely OSMnx cache)

The script currently focuses on analyzing a specific node (ID: 216507089) and visualizing the street network with node and edge information.

## First-Time Setup

### Cache Generation (Recommended)
For optimal performance, generate graph caches before first use:

```bash
# Generate common caches (one-time setup, ~2-5 minutes)
python setup_cache.py

# Or generate specific cache sizes
python generate_cached_graph.py --radius 800 --network-type all
python generate_cached_graph.py --radius 400 --network-type drive
```

This pre-processes street networks with elevation data, reducing application startup from 100+ seconds to <1 second.

## Genetic Algorithm Development

### **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Visualization Requirements**

During GA development, **visualizations are mandatory** at key verification points. All visualizations must:
- Use **OpenStreetMap background** for geographic context
- Show **detailed route overlays** with elevation coloring
- Include **population statistics** and **fitness metrics**
- Save as **PNG images** with descriptive filenames
- Be generated **automatically** during development phases

### **ðŸ§ª CRITICAL: Unit Testing Requirements**

**Unit tests are MANDATORY during GA development.** All GA components must have comprehensive unit test coverage:
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing features
- **Coverage requirement**: >90% test coverage for all GA components
- **Mock dependencies**: Use mocks for external dependencies (matplotlib, file I/O)
- **Fast execution**: Unit tests must complete in <1 second
- **Automatic execution**: Tests run via `python tests/run_tests.py ga`

### **Key Visualization Points:**
1. **Population Initialization**: Show initial population diversity
2. **Crossover Operations**: Verify parent combination correctness
3. **Mutation Effects**: Display mutation impact on routes
4. **Fitness Evolution**: Track population fitness over generations
5. **Final Results**: Compare GA vs TSP route quality

### **Visualization Standards:**
```python
# Example visualization call
visualizer = GAVisualizer(graph)
visualizer.save_population_map(
    population=current_population,
    generation=gen_num,
    filename=f"population_gen_{gen_num:03d}.png",
    show_fitness=True,
    show_elevation=True,
    osm_background=True
)
```

### **Development Verification Protocol:**
- Generate visualization **before and after** each major operation
- Save **fitness progression plots** every 25 generations
- Create **comparison images** between TSP and GA results
- Include **elevation profile overlays** for route analysis
- Document **unexpected behaviors** with annotated images
